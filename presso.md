## What is a Unit Test?

Create slides and present them without ever leaving your terminal.

---

## Kinds of Unit Test

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Execute code directly inside the slides")
}
```

You can execute code inside your slides by pressing `<C-e>`,
the output of your command will be displayed at the end of the current slide.
